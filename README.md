Planner App
## Description
  
Creating a Planner-App that stores different events/ tasks during business hours by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
When an event is logged, it gets set to localStorage.
Each block is color coded based on the current hour, with events in the past being greyed out, current event has a background color of red and future events are in the green area.
Tasks stay on the page when the page is refreshed by using preventDefault.
